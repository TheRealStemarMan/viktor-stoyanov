            <div id="introduction">
                Viktor Stoyanov is Bulgaria's first "Batchelor". This is what really turned him into a public figure and started his career as a celebrety and
                entrepreneur. Viktor is well known for making being a gentleman popular again amongs Bulgarian youth, this is something that he didn't do on 
            purpose but just by simply being himself. Either way, it was a good thing that made him even more likable and was needed for younger men.
            After the show ended, Viktor went to be a part of many advertisements, movies, music videos and many many podcasts and interviews.

                Brief History
            </h2>
            <div id="brief-history">
                Before he got invited to be on the show, he had a career as an athlete, ever since he was a kid, Viktor was the sports type.
                He tried many different sports ranging from football to swimming and a few fighting sports, but what truly stuck with him was Academic Rolling.
                Viktor fell in love with this sport and went to compete in the world championship a few times. He had plans to go to Harvard with a 
                recommendation from the Bulgarian national team. All looked well until one day Viktor sustained a terrible injury that would stop him from performing
                any phisical training for the next 2 years. All he had worked towards in the last 10 years slipped away just like that, what followed was a depression
                and feeling of being lost and having seemingly no future. It took a while but Viktor started to come back to his old self. What followed was a period
                of self discovery and new experiences, just like the way he found Academic Rolling, he tried many new undertakings before he found out that the camera 
                loves him. After a few short appearences in music videos, movies and advertisements, the producers of "The Bachelor" noticed him and gave him a call. It
                was a rather difficult decision for him but with a lot of incouregment from friends and family, Viktor accepted the opportunity.
